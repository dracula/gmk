### [GMK Dracula](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=100727.0)

#### Intro

GMK Dracula turns the software aesthetic into keyboard keyset form, expanding the theme even further with add-on modules. The set features dark greyish blue tones with dark blue-purple-gray alphas. The default legend color is a contrasting neutral/cool white, which adds to the overall legibility of the classic text + icon legends. In addition, the Core and add-on modules include legends and accent keys in various pastel and neon colors, all based on selected Dracula Theme colors.
